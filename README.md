# Progressive Flow Whitepaper

## Introduction

### What is Progressive Flow?
Progressive Flow is a Git paradigm, parallel to Git Flow, designed to address one of its main issues: the bottleneck caused by release management.

Those who have used Git Flow on dynamic projects in collaborative teams may have faced the challenge of managing multiple parallel features generated by customer requests. Initially, the process works smoothly: tasks proceed, features are developed and completed, and the first completed change initiates the opening of a release. However, this is where critical issues arise.

Closed features are progressively added to the release while awaiting client approval. If a single feature takes longer than expected to be approved or, worse, requires complex rework, all subsequent changes remain stuck in the release. This situation creates a backlog, delays testing, and prevents the release of changes that are already ready.

### The Progressive Flow Solution
Progressive Flow was designed to overcome these limitations. By introducing the intermediate `candidate` branch, it eliminates bottlenecks and ensures a continuous flow, fully aligning with CI/CD principles. This approach allows approved changes to be isolated from those still under development, ensuring quick releases, accurate testing, and better management of ongoing activities.

## Paradigm Overview

Progressive Flow is proposed as an improved alternative to Git Flow, designed to resolve its structural limitations. Its approach focuses on the independent management of features, keeping them ready for release at any time without creating bottlenecks in the development and release process.

### The Benefits of Progressive Flow

- **Flexibility:** Progressive Flow allows for more frequent and independent releases, adhering to the fundamental principles of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
- **Familiarity:** Strongly inspired by Git Flow, Progressive Flow maintains a similar workflow.
- **Conflict Reduction:** Thanks to the introduction of the intermediate `candidate` branch, it enables partial merges between the `candidate` and `release` branches.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Development teams can work in parallel without blocks or delays.
- **Scalability Support:** Suitable for complex or dynamic projects.
- **Traceability and Control:** Intermediate branches and structured workflows improve change tracking.

## Differences with Other Paradigms

### Progressive Flow vs. Git Flow
- **Release Flexibility:** The `candidate` branch allows selective feature integration.
- **Complexity:** Progressive Flow improves the modularity of features.

### Progressive Flow vs. GitHub Flow
- **Support for Multiple Environments:** Progressive Flow includes testing and approvals.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for complex workflows.

### Progressive Flow vs. Trunk-Based Development
- **Focus on Stability:** Progressive Flow offers greater control with the `candidate` branch.
- **Risk of Premature Releases:** Reduces the risk of integrating untested changes.

## Technical Details

### Candidates
`Candidates` are branches that originate from `develop` and represent functionalities eligible for release.

#### How Do Candidates Work?
1. **Creation:** Each new `candidate` originates from `develop`.
2. **Development:** All developments are carried out within the `candidate`.
3. **Staging Testing:** Changes are integrated into the `release` branch.
4. **Approval:** After testing, the `candidate` is ready for release.
5. **Closure and Merge:** Changes are merged into `develop` and `master`.

#### Key Differences
- **Feature:** Used for development, integrated into `develop`.
- **Candidate:** Remains open until final approval.
- **Release:** Aggregated state of `candidates` ready for production.

## Conclusion
Progressive Flow represents a step forward in managing software development workflows. With the introduction of the `candidate` branches, it offers greater flexibility, supports faster releases, and reduces bottlenecks.
